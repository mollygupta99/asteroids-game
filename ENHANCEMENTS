The overall high score for the local machine is displayed directly below the lives in the top left corner. Every time the high score 
is changed, it is saved into the scores file. The file is searched through using an optimization loop. The highest score out of all
is found and displayed. The overall high score updates during the game if the player manages to score higher.

Below the overall high score is the high score for the player in session. Every time a new screen is opened, the high score is set
to zero, as a new session has begun. However, the score does not reset when the new game button is pressed. The high school updates
every time the player scores above the player's personal high score during the game.
